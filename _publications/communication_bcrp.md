As a research assistant at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, I collaborated with Prof. Marco Vega on a project that applies Natural Language Processing and Structural Topic Model to analyze tone and topics described in inflation reports. This was aligned with the bank's interest in studying how their communication influences market expectations.
