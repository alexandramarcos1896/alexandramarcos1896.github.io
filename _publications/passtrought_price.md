I conducted research that aims to quantify the impact of the exchange rate pass-through on online retail prices. During my internship, I worked scraping and cleaning big data of retail prices. Since I was so involved in the activities, it ended up being my thesis project. Six months later, I presented the main results at a conference in front of a challenging audience.
