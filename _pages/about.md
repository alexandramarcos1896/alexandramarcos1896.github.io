A committed and proactive economist with a strong passion for pursuing a PhD in Data Science. Currently working as a project manager and research assistant, I am driven by a desire to explore how algorithms can address pressing economic and social challenges. My primary interest lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Perception, where data-driven solutions have transformative potential.

I discovered my passion for Econometrics while earning the highest mark in an Applied Econometrics course, further reinforced by a research internship at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. My experience includes implementing machine learning models within justice agencies, presenting at academic conferences, and contributing to the development of research papers.
