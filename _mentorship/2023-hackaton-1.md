# Innova & Business Fest Hackathon: "Disruption in Liabilities" with Mibanco

As part of my ongoing mentorship role at the Maker Lab, I’ve had the privilege of guiding talented students through one of the most impactful hackathons aimed at transforming the future of microfinancing. This hackathon is in collaboration with Mibanco, the second-largest microfinance bank in the world and the leader in the Latin American region.

## About the Hackathon
The Innova & Business Fest Hackathon focuses on solving critical challenges in the transaccionalidad (transactions) and ahorro (savings) sectors for entrepreneurs. Mibanco is well-recognized for its credit products, but it seeks to unlock new opportunities by enhancing savings and investment products, commonly referred to as "passive products". However, there’s a significant challenge: many entrepreneurs, especially in underserved communities, face high levels of informality in their businesses, making them hesitant to adopt traditional savings and investment tools.

This creates a unique opportunity to innovate, providing solutions that not only offer value to the clients but also help raise their financial literacy and promote the use of digital financial tools. The hackathon aims to tackle two core design challenges that will directly affect the daily lives of entrepreneurs and contribute to the development of stronger financial systems.

## Hackathon Challenges
The teams in the hackathon are tasked with solving one of the following key challenges:

### Challenge 1 - Focused on Transactions:
"How can we daily empower the entrepreneur to make Mibanco the most convenient and affordable solution for her transactions (payments, withdrawals, and transfers)?"
### Challenge 2 - Focused on Savings:
"How can we encourage entrepreneurs to save, preparing them better for unforeseen circumstances and helping them achieve their goals?"
These challenges aim to push the boundaries of financial technology by addressing the lack of access to reliable savings tools and making financial transactions more accessible and user-friendly for entrepreneurs.

## Learning Through Innovation
The hackathon is designed to not only generate creative, viable solutions but also to instill a deep understanding of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs, especially those in vulnerable or informal sectors. Mibanco’s ultimate goal is to support these entrepreneurs and level the playing field through innovation. Participants in the hackathon will be able to sharpen their skills in innovation, technology, and critical thinking, developing solutions that can directly impact the way microfinancing works.

## Target Audience
This hackathon is open to undergraduate and graduate students from Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). The event calls on students with a passion for interdisciplinary work, collaboration, and solving real-world problems. Students who are eager to dive into innovation, technology, and social entrepreneurship are encouraged to participate. This is an excellent opportunity for them to apply their academic knowledge to create practical, life-changing solutions for Peru’s entrepreneurial community.

## Hackathon Process
Participants are provided with a brief of the hackathon created by Mibanco, where they will be able to access essential information regarding the target users, the specific problems they face, and the tools available to help them. The goal is to develop comprehensive and innovative solutions using technology to improve the transaction experience and savings behavior among entrepreneurs.

Additionally, experts from Mibanco will share updated information on the main challenges during virtual workshops. These workshops are designed to enhance participants’ understanding of the problem space and inspire them to create feasible, scalable, and impactful solutions.

## Why This Hackathon Matters
In an increasingly digital world, it’s essential that financial institutions rethink how they provide services to underserved communities. By mentoring this hackathon, I’ve seen firsthand how innovative solutions, when nurtured in the right environment, can help transform entire industries. I’m proud to be part of a movement that encourages the next generation of leaders to focus on financial inclusion, innovation, and social impact.

This hackathon represents more than just a competition — it’s an opportunity for students to get hands-on experience, work with industry experts, and contribute to shaping a more inclusive and accessible financial ecosystem. Through this experience, participants not only grow their technical skills but also gain a deeper appreciation for the social implications of financial products and services.
